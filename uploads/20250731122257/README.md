# AWS Project Report

This AWS project automates the backup of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) using Lambda functions triggered by CloudWatch Events, and notifies users of the backup status via Simple Notification Service (SNS).

AWS services used:
1. Lambda: Executes the backup process for the AMIs.
2. CloudWatch Events: Triggers the Lambda function at specified intervals to initiate the backup.
3. SNS: Sends notifications to users regarding the backup status.

How the automation works:
1. CloudWatch Events is configured to trigger a Lambda function at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly).
2. The Lambda function executes the backup process by creating snapshots of the specified AMIs.
3. Once the backup process is complete, the Lambda function sends a notification to SNS with the backup status.
4. Users receive notifications via email or SMS through SNS.

Deployment flow in 4-5 steps:
1. Set up IAM roles and policies for Lambda to access necessary resources.
2. Create a Lambda function that performs the AMI backup process.
3. Set up CloudWatch Events to trigger the Lambda function at specified intervals.
4. Configure SNS to receive notifications from the Lambda function and notify users of the backup status.
5. Test the automation by triggering the CloudWatch Events manually and verifying the backup process and notification delivery.
